The next step where to copy paste every thing from the pdf of my profile, no time to clean up just take it all.

After that I added:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>Generate a cover letter <span style=color:#66d9ef>for</span> this job:

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>I am excited to apply for the position of Data Backend Engineer at Embark. With my extensive experience in machine learning and data engineering, I am confident that I can make significant contributions to your team.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>At Northvolt, I have been working on applications for electrode manufacturing where I wrote code in Python, Go, and SQL to aggregate data. As a Data Scientist at Sandvik, I worked on predictive models using deep learning techniques. Moreover, I have contributed to Jupyter Hub, Apache Beam, Kubeflow, Argo, and Tekton, and I am an active open-source enthusiast.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>I am skilled in distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and building data-driven applications, which are some of the core requirements for the Data Backend Engineer role at Embark. I have also worked on database optimization and written ad-hoc SQL queries for data analysis, which will come in handy while collaborating with other teams to build solutions.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>I am passionate about interactive experiences, games, and new technologies, and I would love to apply my skills to the gaming industry. I have experience building services that are easy to deploy, scale, and maintain, which aligns with Embark&#39;s engineering practices.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and contribute to the development of fun, engaging games.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Sincerely,
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>[Your Name]
</span></span></code></pre></div><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>The cover letter is pretty good and I would probably not make it better myself after all I am a engineer not a write. It managed to screw up my name vs the recruiting manager but that it. Will be interesting to see how this affects the importance of cover letters in the future. Also what is really cool is that I can now chat about my cover letter to get it improved how ever I fancy. I think this will be a great tool to work smarter and reduce the time spend on boring things, however it will also flood the internet with generated content and what is original and real will be harder and harder to distinguish.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2024 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>

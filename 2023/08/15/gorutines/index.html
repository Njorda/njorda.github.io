shown you know how to use the first one.”
–Paul Barham</p></blockquote><p>We will not deep dive in to when to use and not to use <code>Gorutines</code> specifically even though we touch upon some hints. However concurrency introduces a lot of complexity and makes code both harder to read and debug - so only use it when needed.</p><p><code>Gorutines</code> are a concept in Go for starting a concurrent(or possibly parallel function depending upon the available resources). From the definition in <a href=https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#concurrency>Effective Go</a> we can read:</p><blockquote><p>A goroutine has a simple model: it is a function executing concurrently with other goroutines in the same address space.</p></blockquote><p>But what does this mean? The first thing that is good to know is that the main function of a go program is a <code>Gorutine</code> and creating <code>Gorutines</code> using the keyword <code>go</code> is the same as the main <code>Gorutine</code>. <code>Gorutines</code> are multiplexed on to OS threads. This means that multiple <code>Gorutines</code> are run on the same thread. If one function call blocks the OS thread the go runtime will automatically move <code>Gorutines</code> to other OS threads in order to unblock them. The goal with <code>Gorutines</code> is to make concurrency easier for to use while having a high performance for concurrent task avoiding the cost of creating a large amount of OS threads(which is expensive to create and delete). <code>Gorutines</code> have a low overhead beyond the overhead of the memory of the gorutine stack. In order to make the stack as small as possible Go uses a runtime resizable, bounded stacks. This means that the stack is allow grow. When the stack is reaching is max, it is copied to a larger memory section allowing it to grow further(the stack is also allowed to shrink). It should be noticed that Go copies the whole stack to a new location rather than allowing it to live in multiple sections of memory. <code>Gorutines</code> are described by <a href=https://dave.cheney.net/tag/goroutines>Dave Chenny</a> as:</p><blockquote><p>Go’s goroutines sit right in the middle, the same programmer interface as threads, a nice imperative coding model, but also efficient implementation model based on coroutines.</p></blockquote><p>Gorutines and the runtime are created to handle a large amount(think 100k or more) of <code>Gorutines</code> but even though the memory footprint is low it is still something. Thus we can not have an infinite number of them, due to this spinning up <code>Gorutines</code> that don&rsquo;t finish will create a potential memory leak. This result in a very important consideration when creating <code>Gorutines</code> - when will it stop - in order to avoid leaking memory. When using <code>Gorutines</code> always be aware of when they start or finish.</p><h1 id=runtime-scheduling>Runtime scheduling</h1><p>The Go program will show up as a single process requesting and running multiple threads. The runtime scheduler is responsible for how the <code>Gorutines</code> are scheduled on to the OS threads. Go uses the <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/go1.21.0:src/runtime/debug.go;l=16"><code>GOMAXPROCS</code></a> env to set the maximum nbr of CPUs that can be used. However if your processor has <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading>hyper-threading</a> each hardware thread will be considered one process(this is called P by the go runtime). The go scheduler is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking>cooperative scheduler</a> which in short means that each the runtime will not initialize a context switch but the <code>Gorutines</code> will yield to other <code>Gorutines</code>. <code>Gorutines</code> has three high level states:</p><ul><li>Waiting - Refers to that a <code>Gorutine</code> is waiting for something, such as synchronization calls or OS calls.</li><li>Runnable - A <code>Gorutine</code> is ready to run and wants time on a thread in order to execute its instructions.</li><li>Executing - A <code>Gorutine</code> is running on a thread.</li></ul><p>Go uses three abstractions for the scheduling of <code>Gorutines</code>, more info can be found <a href=https://go.dev/src/runtime/HACKING>here</a>:</p><ul><li>G - stands for <code>Gorutine</code></li><li>M - is a OS thread</li><li>P - is resource required to execute Go code(for example memory allocated space). The number of P:s are equal to GOMAXPROCS(which is default to the nbr of threads tha can be run on the cores).</li></ul><p>The schedulers are responsible for matching the Gorutines, G to the P:s which then matches it on to the M. We stated that OS threads are expensive to create and destroy and thus we only want to create a limited nbr. The go runtime will only create OS threads to match P, however if a OS threads is blocked the runtime will look for free threads or create a new.</p><p>In order to allow for a large amount of <code>Gorutines</code> each P has a queue of G:s ready to run. These are then handled by the P or stolen using <code>work stealing</code>(steels half of some other P:s queue) in order to balance the load evenly by other P:s. For long running G:s that don&rsquo;t have synchronization points the G:s are moved to a global queue that are given a lower priority in order to not block other G:s. Also if the distributed run queues for each P is full the G:s will be added to the global run queue.</p><h1 id=resources>Resources:</h1><ul><li><a href=https://go.dev/doc/faq#goroutines>Go docs</a></li><li><a href=https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#goroutines>Effective Go</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNt-qp7FpQ">A deep dive in to Go&rsquo;s stack (Go Time Live!)</a></li><li><a href=https://dave.cheney.net/tag/goroutines>Never start a goroutine without knowing how it will stop</a></li><li><a href=https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html>Scheduling In Go : Part II - Go Scheduler</a></li><li><a href=https://povilasv.me/go-scheduler/>Go scheduler: Ms, Ps & Gs</a></li><li><a href=https://speakerdeck.com/retervision/go-runtime-scheduler>Go runtime scheduler</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHRO5WQGh0k">GopherCon 2018: Kavya Joshi - The Scheduler Saga</a></li></ul></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2023 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>

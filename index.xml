For example data we will use the Recursive queries blog post and the set up provided in the post as well, and thus not go over how to bring up the env in this post.
Avoiding cycles Writing Recursive queries it is easy to have cycles that. For a process at work I tried to do a graph traversal but ended up in a infinite loop, to avoid spilling sensitive information we will rely on a mock example based upon this example.</description></item><item><title>SQL for gcloud bucket</title><link>https://www.njordy.com/2024/01/16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.njordy.com/2024/01/16/</guid><description>TLDR: https://github.com/Njorda/cloudsql/tree/main
The goal with this blog post is to build a small tool to query Google Cloud buckets. We will do this using ChatGPT, I feel like I need to be even better at prompting for coding help. So to start by setting some constraints to limit the scope and make it a reasonable task to finish in a hour we will use go and we will limit our self to SELECT with WHERE we will support predicate push downs but thats it.</description></item><item><title>Recursive queries</title><link>https://www.njordy.com/2024/01/10/recursive-sql/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.njordy.com/2024/01/10/recursive-sql/</guid><description>I coupe of weeks ago I came across that Postgres supports recursive queries and thus we will take a deep dive in this blog post on the concept of recursion in SQL. The docs for postgres and recursive queries can be found here if you are not familiar with CTE I recommend you to start with that. In this blog post we will start with exploring this concept in Postgres before we jump to DuckDB.</description></item><item><title>How to set up Neon, serverless postgres on k8s</title><link>https://www.njordy.com/2023/11/12/serverless-postgres/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.njordy.com/2023/11/12/serverless-postgres/</guid><description>All the code can be found here
In this blog post we will dive in to how to set up neon on your k8s cluster. We will use Minikube but feel free to use the setup of your choice of k8s. The first step is to define the k8s resources.

In this blog post we will dive into scoped threads, what it is and what is the difference between threads in rust in general. First of all only use threads if you need the speed up, introducing threads to a program adds complexity which both makes the program harder to maintain but if not done correct also slower to run(due to communications between threads and scheduling).</description></item><item><title>Rust Foreign data wrappers for postgres</title><link>https://www.njordy.com/2023/06/12/rust-foreign-data-wrappers-postgres-rust/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.njordy.com/2023/06/12/rust-foreign-data-wrappers-postgres-rust/</guid><description>Background In this blog post we will try to implement a foreign data wrappers for postgres in rust. We will build on top of pgx in order to not have to build everything from the ground. But first of what is a foreign data wrapper? From the postgres docs:

Bloom filters can be used to quickly check if a value don&amp;rsquo;t exists or might exists in a set, false positives are possible(with a low likelihood) but false negatives are not possible. The time to check if an element exsist or add an element is also constant O(k), where k is the number of hash functions(we will covert this later).</description></item><item><title>Setting up a Basic dbt Development Container for BigQuery in GCP</title><link>https://www.njordy.com/2023/04/29/setting-up-basic-dbt-dev-container/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.njordy.com/2023/04/29/setting-up-basic-dbt-dev-container/</guid><description>In this post, you will learn how to set up a basic dbt project in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and share a development container to kickstart your project.

This is a follow up to Go memory arenas for apache arrow, Part 1.
First of all why do we want to manage memory manually instead of using the GC? One of arrows key features is it support to share memory with out copy between programs however for a GC collected language this will not work that great.</description></item><item><title>Push based query engine</title><link>https://www.njordy.com/2023/05/17push_based_query_engine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.njordy.com/2023/05/17push_based_query_engine/</guid><description>In this blog post we will dive down in to the difference between push based vs pull based query engines. As simple as is sounds push based is based upon that data is pushed from the sink through the different operators, this is used by snowflake and argued to be superior for OLAP which we will dive deeper into. Pull based have been around for a longer time and is based upon that data is pulled from the sink up through the operators, this is also known as theVolcano Iterator Model</description></item><item><title>Go memory arenas for apache arrow, Part 1</title><link>https://www.njordy.com/2023/03/23/apache-arrow-memory-arena-go/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.njordy.com/2023/03/23/apache-arrow-memory-arena-go/</guid><description>This blog post will try to dive down in to apache arrow and specifically the Go memory allocation for Apache arrow. Apache arrow state that they allow for the following types of memory allocations:

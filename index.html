In this blog post we will dive down in to how to build a small CLI for sharing files. The goal is to go over how to build a go cli for sharing files. We will set it up so that a shareable link will be created with a set expiration time and the object will be cleaned up after twice that time. For a file we will do the following:&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2024/04/17/share_it/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2024/04/07/nsys_profile/>Profile nvidia triton model server</a></h1><time>Mar 1, 2024</time><br><div class=description>In order to profile the triton on the GPU we will use NVIDIA Nsight Systems. Installation instructions can be found here. Older version of Nsigh systems can be found here.The first step is to generate a nsys report. This can be done using the following command(you need to continue reading if you want to get all the traces and build NVIDIA triton image):

Lets start with a problem that consistent hashing would help solve. Imagine we have a distributed systems with 3 database. Business is booming and we realize we need to scale out to more shards.

This will be based upon the awesome material from CUDA MODE. Today we will focuse on the material in the first two lectures and start to build some simples stuff in CUDA.
Background Cuda is an API from Nvidia for programming GPU:s. GPU:s are pwoerful hardware for highly parallel processes. If the process is not highly parallels GPU:s is probably not the right hardware for you.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2024/02/16/cuda_programming/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2024/01/21/python-tricks.md>Python tricks</a></h1><time>Jan 28, 2024</time><br><div class=description>The blog post will just be a long list of short summaries of python tricks, that I find good and like to remember(and find fast).

For example data we will use the Recursive queries blog post and the set up provided in the post as well, and thus not go over how to bring up the env in this post.
Avoiding cycles Writing Recursive queries it is easy to have cycles that. For a process at work I tried to do a graph traversal but ended up in a infinite loop, to avoid spilling sensitive information we will rely on a mock example based upon this example.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2024/01/19/recursive-sql-learnings/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2024/01/16/>SQL for gcloud bucket</a></h1><time>Jan 16, 2024</time><br><div class=description>TLDR: https://github.com/Njorda/cloudsql/tree/main
The goal with this blog post is to build a small tool to query Google Cloud buckets. We will do this using ChatGPT, I feel like I need to be even better at prompting for coding help. So to start by setting some constraints to limit the scope and make it a reasonable task to finish in a hour we will use go and we will limit our self to SELECT with WHERE we will support predicate push downs but thats it.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2024/01/16/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2024/01/10/recursive-sql/>Recursive queries</a></h1><time>Jan 10, 2024</time><br><div class=description>I coupe of weeks ago I came across that Postgres supports recursive queries and thus we will take a deep dive in this blog post on the concept of recursion in SQL.

In this blog post we will dive in to how to set up neon on your k8s cluster. We will use Minikube but feel free to use the setup of your choice of k8s. The first step is to define the k8s resources.

For example data we will use the Recursive queries blog post and the set up provided in the post as well, and thus not go over how to bring up the env in this post.
Avoiding cycles Writing Recursive queries it is easy to have cycles that. For a process at work I tried to do a graph traversal but ended up in a infinite loop, to avoid spilling sensitive information we will rely on a mock example based upon this example.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2024/01/19/recursive-sql-learnings/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2024/01/16/>SQL for gcloud bucket</a></h1><time>Jan 16, 2024</time><br><div class=description>TLDR: https://github.com/Njorda/cloudsql/tree/main
The goal with this blog post is to build a small tool to query Google Cloud buckets. We will do this using ChatGPT, I feel like I need to be even better at prompting for coding help. So to start by setting some constraints to limit the scope and make it a reasonable task to finish in a hour we will use go and we will limit our self to SELECT with WHERE we will support predicate push downs but thats it.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2024/01/16/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2024/01/10/recursive-sql/>Recursive queries</a></h1><time>Jan 10, 2024</time><br><div class=description>I coupe of weeks ago I came across that Postgres supports recursive queries and thus we will take a deep dive in this blog post on the concept of recursion in SQL.

In this blog post we will dive in to how to set up neon on your k8s cluster. We will use Minikube but feel free to use the setup of your choice of k8s. The first step is to define the k8s resources.

First, you need to create a Docker image. Something very simple should suffice. Here is a sample Dockerfile:
FROM python:3 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim RUN python -m pip install pandas After creating the Dockerfile, the next step is to build and push the image to Artifact Registry.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/09/02/docker-iterations/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/08/15/gorutines/>Gorutines - deep dive into Go:s concurrency features</a></h1><time>Aug 15, 2023</time><br><div class=description>Gorutine high level Go:s native concurrency features is usually one of the first things developers bring up when describing the advantages of using go.

In this blog post we will dive into scoped threads, what it is and what is the difference between threads in rust in general. First of all only use threads if you need the speed up, introducing threads to a program adds complexity which both makes the program harder to maintain but if not done correct also slower to run(due to communications between threads and scheduling).&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/07/30/rust-scoped-threads/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/06/12/rust-foreign-data-wrappers-postgres-rust/>Rust Foreign data wrappers for postgres</a></h1><time>Jun 12, 2023</time><br><div class=description>Background In this blog post we will try to implement a foreign data wrappers for postgres in rust. We will build on top of pgx in order to not have to build everything from the ground. But first of what is a foreign data wrapper? From the postgres docs:
A foreign data wrapper is a library that can communicate with an external data source, hiding the details of connecting to the data source and obtaining data from it.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/06/12/rust-foreign-data-wrappers-postgres-rust/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"></span><span class="page-item page-next"><a href=./page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>Next →</span></a></span></ul></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2024 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>

First, you need to create a Docker image. Something very simple should suffice. Here is a sample Dockerfile:
FROM python:3 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim RUN python -m pip install pandas After creating the Dockerfile, the next step is to build and push the image to Artifact Registry.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/09/02/docker-iterations/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/08/15/gorutines/>Gorutines - deep dive into Go:s concurrency features</a></h1><time>Aug 15, 2023</time><br><div class=description>Gorutine high level Go:s native concurrency features is usually one of the first things developers bring up when describing the advantages of using go.

In this blog post we will dive into scoped threads, what it is and what is the difference between threads in rust in general. First of all only use threads if you need the speed up, introducing threads to a program adds complexity which both makes the program harder to maintain but if not done correct also slower to run(due to communications between threads and scheduling).&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/07/30/rust-scoped-threads/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/06/12/rust-foreign-data-wrappers-postgres-rust/>Rust Foreign data wrappers for postgres</a></h1><time>Jun 12, 2023</time><br><div class=description>Background In this blog post we will try to implement a foreign data wrappers for postgres in rust. We will build on top of pgx in order to not have to build everything from the ground. But first of what is a foreign data wrapper? From the postgres docs:
A foreign data wrapper is a library that can communicate with an external data source, hiding the details of connecting to the data source and obtaining data from it.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/06/12/rust-foreign-data-wrappers-postgres-rust/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/05/19/operating_system_databases/>DBOS: A Database-Oriented Operating System</a></h1><time>May 19, 2023</time><br><div class=description>A group of researches are proposing a radical change of the future operating system. Replacing the fundamental idea from Unix that everything is a file and instead relying on concepts from the database world a operating system that supports large scale distributed applications in the cloud can be built.

The core principles suggested to achieve this is:

Bloom filters can be used to quickly check if a value don&rsquo;t exists or might exists in a set, false positives are possible(with a low likelihood) but false negatives are not possible.

We will build on top of pgx in order to not have to build everything from the ground. But first of what is a foreign data wrapper? From the postgres docs:
A foreign data wrapper is a library that can communicate with an external data source, hiding the details of connecting to the data source and obtaining data from it.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/06/12/rust-foreign-data-wrappers-postgres-rust/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/05/19/operating_system_databases/>DBOS: A Database-Oriented Operating System</a></h1><time>May 19, 2023</time><br><div class=description>A group of researches are proposing a radical change of the future operating system. Replacing the fundamental idea from Unix that everything is a file and instead relying on concepts from the database world a operating system that supports large scale distributed applications in the cloud can be built.

The core principles suggested to achieve this is:

Bloom filters can be used to quickly check if a value don&rsquo;t exists or might exists in a set, false positives are possible(with a low likelihood) but false negatives are not possible. The time to check if an element exsist or add an element is also constant O(k), where k is the number of hash functions(we will covert this later).&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/05/17/bloom_filter/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/04/29/setting-up-basic-dbt-dev-container/>Setting up a Basic dbt Development Container for BigQuery in GCP</a></h1><time>Apr 29, 2023</time><br><div class=description>In this post, you will learn how to set up a basic dbt project in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and share a development container to kickstart your project. While there are numerous blog posts out there about dbt and BigQuery, none of them share how to set it up in a development container without using any of the dbt-cloud services (at least to my knowledge).

This is a follow up to Go memory arenas for apache arrow, Part 1.
First of all why do we want to manage memory manually instead of using the GC? One of arrows key features is it support to share memory with out copy between programs however for a GC collected language this will not work that great.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/04/14/apache-arrow-memory-arena-go-part-2/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/05/17push_based_query_engine/>Push based query engine</a></h1><time>Apr 14, 2023</time><br><div class=description>In this blog post we will dive down in to the difference between push based vs pull based query engines. As simple as is sounds push based is based upon that data is pushed from the sink through the different operators, this is used by snowflake and argued to be superior for OLAP which we will dive deeper into. Pull based have been around for a longer time and is based upon that data is pulled from the sink up through the operators, this is also known as theVolcano Iterator Model&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=./2023/05/17push_based_query_engine/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=./2023/03/23/apache-arrow-memory-arena-go/>Go memory arenas for apache arrow, Part 1</a></h1><time>Mar 29, 2023</time><br><div class=description>This blog post will try to dive down in to apache arrow and specifically the Go memory allocation for Apache arrow.

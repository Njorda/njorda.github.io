In this blog post we will try to implement a foreign data wrappers for postgres in rust. We will build on top of [pgx](https://github.com/tcdi/pgx) in order to not have to build everything from the ground. But first of what is a foreign data wrapper? From the [postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-foreign-data.html#:~:text=A%20foreign%20data%20wrapper%20is,and%20obtaining%20data%20from%20it.): 

> A foreign data wrapper is a library that can communicate with an external data source, hiding the details of connecting to the data source and obtaining data from it. 

So to say it simple, a foreign data wrapper add functionality to access a external data source. In this case we will create a wrapper for [duckdb}(https://duckdb.org/). This will be heavily inspired from [this repository](https://github.com/supabase/wrappers) from [superbase](https://www.superbase.com/).

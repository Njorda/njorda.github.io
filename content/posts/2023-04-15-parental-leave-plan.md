These are the projects I will focus on during my parental leave: 

1) [Advanced databases systems](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2023/) course at CMU
2) [Self-Driving Database Management Systems at CMU
](https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/project1.html) more material on projects [here](https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/syllabus.html#project1)
3) [Apache arrow go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/arrow/go/arrow)
4) [Duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) serverless, or lambda

Try to work in rust as much as possible while doing cloud stuff in rust. 

# Advanced databases systems

Gaol is to: 
- summarize all the lectures
- do the projects(in rust)

in order to lear more about Online Analytical Processing. 

Project: 
- go duckdb
- constant vector duckdb for time series delta delta compressed
- neon databases
- Infinite storage for postgres extension, move things to bucket


# Self-Driving Database Management Systems

Goal is to: 
- Learn how databases are tuned.

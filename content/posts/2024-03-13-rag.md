- Modular Rag

Benchmark for measuring performance. 


# RAG

Retrive Augment Generate = RAG


Address: 
- Up to date data

Workflow: 
1) Partition in to chunks


# Naive rag

BLA BLA BLA


# Advanced RAG

Pre-retrival ->
    - Indexing approaches: 
        - Sliding windows
        - Add meta data to chunks
Optimize the index strategy by enhancing the data that is indexed :
    - Enhancing data granularity -> Remove irrelevant information, 
    - Optimize index structures
    - Adding metadata
    - Alignment optimization -> Add hypotetical questions in to documents
    - Mixed retrival


Retrival:
    - Fine tuning embeddings, add more domain knowledge to the embeddings
    - GPT 3.5 turbo offers this

Post-retrival:
    - Reranking to put the most relevant documents to the edge
    - LostInTHEMiddleRanker
    - Prompt Compression


# Modular RAG


I have thought about it I still feel like the right thing for me is to move on.
